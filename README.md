# Overview

In this project, we will build a Github repository from scratch and create a scaffolding that will assist us in performing both Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. We'll use Github Actions along with a Makefile, requirements.txt and application code to perform an initial lint, test, and install cycle. Next, we'll integrate this project with Azure Pipelines to enable Continuous Delivery to Azure App Service.

## Project Plan
to follow DevOps best practices, we have built a KANBAN board in Trello (link is provided below). we have also built a complete project plan spreadsheet showing quarterly goals as well as yearly goals. The second tab in teh spreadsheet also shows the tasks need to be done in order to achieve the desired goals in first quarter (link to spreadsheet is provided below):

To be able to run the python project, you need to first clone the repo using SSH or HTTP provided in the page (https://github.com/elastific/Building-a-CI-CD-Pipeline).

You also need to make sure you build a virtual environment either on your local machine (using conda or venv) that runs python 3.5. When the venv is setup, make sure to activate it, then install all the dependensies listed in requirements.txt file (could be via `pip isnatll -r requirements.txt` or `make install`).
When you first run the app.py in a terminal, you need to open up a second terminal to be able to test (run make_prediction.sh for local, or make_predict_azure_app.sh for Azure Cloud Shell).

* Successful prediction from deployed flask app in Azure Cloud Shell.  [Using this file as a template for the deployed prediction](https://github.com/udacity/nd082-Azure-Cloud-DevOps-Starter-Code/blob/master/C2-AgileDevelopmentwithAzure/project/starter_files/flask-sklearn/make_predict_azure_app.sh).

## Enhancements

- The Application webpage is extremely simple and has no way of outputting the prediction in the page, we can work on that.
- The model has been built using rather old version of scikit-learn that has stopped supporting some of the modules used in the model, so a re-train of the model seems inevitable.
- Tests done using Pytest are all trivial, we could build and implement some serious tests
- a mobile app could be built
- technical reference documentation could be developed and published
- having music, illustrations, animations, etc added to the webpag
